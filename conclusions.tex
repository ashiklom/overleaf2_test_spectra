\section{Conclusions} \label{s:conclusions} 

This paper demonstrates a novel approach to performing radiative transfer
model inversion that explicitly takes into account uncertainty and covariance
in parameter estimates. Our validation shows that the accuracy of our method
is comparable to that of other studies when using field spectra. Our idealized
sensor simulation exercise clearly demonstrated how the spectral configuration
of different sensors affects their ability to inform different RTM parameters.
Although our finding that RTM inversion accuracy and precision increase with
spectral resolution is not surprising, we highlght the fact that by combining
the spectral information content of just two multispectral sensors like
Landsat and MODIS, we dramatically improve our inversion estimates. We hope
our work will be integrated into existing approaches to multi-temporal,
multi-sensor retrieval of vegetation parameters to enhance our capability to
observe vegetation remotely and enhance our understanding of ecosystem
processes.
