abstract = {This study presents a methodology to estimate the leaf biochemical compounds specific absorption coefficients and to use them to predict leaf biochemistry. A wide range of leaves was collected including variations in species and leaf status. All the leaves were dried out. The biochemical composition was measured using classical wet chemistry techniques to determine lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, stach, and protein contents. Concurrently, leaf reflectance, and transmittance were measured with a high spectral resolution spectrophotometer in the 800-2500 nm range with approximately 1 nm spectral resolution and sampling interval. In addition, infinite reflectance achieved by stacking leaves was also measured. The PROSPECT leaf optical properties model was first inverted over a selection of wavebands in the 800-2400 nm domain to provide estimates of the scattering characteristics using leaf reflectance, transmittance, and infinite reflectance data. Then, the model was inverted again over all the wavelengths to estimate the global absorption coefficient, using the previously estimated scattering properties. The global absorption coefficient was eventually explained using the measured biochemical composition by fitting the corresponding specific absorption coefficients after substraction of the measured contribution of the residual structural water absorption. Results show that the derived specific absorption coefficients are quite robustly estimated. Further, they are in good agreement with known absorption features of each biochemical compound. The average contribution of each biochemical compound to leaf absorption feature is also evaluated. Sugar, cellulose, and hemicellulose are the main compounds that contribute to absorption. Results demonstrate the possibility of modeling leaf optical properties of dry leaves with explicit description of leaf biochemistry. Estimates of the detailed biochemical composition obtained by model inversion over the 1300-2400 nm spectral domain show poor predictive performances. In particular, the protein content is very poorly retrieved. The retrieval performances of several combinations of the biochemical compounds are investigated. Results show that the total amount of dry matter per unit leaf area is the only variable to be accurately retrieved. Possible improvements of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Friedl2002,
abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.

@article{LeMaire2004,
abstract = {Fifty-three leaves were randomly sampled on different deciduous tree species, representing a wide range of chlorophyll contents, tree ages, and leaf structural features. Their reflectance was measured between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm step, and their chlorophyll content determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra) was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate, and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices (published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices using reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method). We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks. The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results: Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate indices. The "peak jump" and the multiple-peak feature observed on the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated RMSE=2.1 $\mu$g/cm2 on the experimental database). After calibration on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best performances (RMSECV=1.8 $\mu$g/cm2 on the experimental database). The new Double Difference (DD) index, although not the best on the experimental database (RMSECV=2.9 $\mu$g/cm2), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE=3.7 $\mu$g/cm2) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV=4.5 $\mu$g/cm2). In this leaf-level study, the best indices are very near from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like, neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions will certainly be different for a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based indices may perform significantly better than the other ones. Â© 2003 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Atzberger2012,
abstract = {The robust and accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models (RTM) is seriously hampered by the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. With this research we further develop our previously published (object-based) inversion approach [Atzberger, 2004, RSE 93: 53-67] and evaluate it against simulated Sentinel-2 data. The proposed RTM inversion takes advantage of the geostatistical fact that the biophysical characteristics of nearby pixels are generally more similar than those at a larger distance. This leads to spectral co-variations in the n-dimensional spectral features space, which can be used for regularization purposes. A simple two-step inversion based on PROSPECT+SAIL generated look-up-tables is presented that can be easily adapted to other radiative transfer models. The approach takes into account the spectral signatures of adjacent pixels in gliding (3Ã3) windows. Using a set of leaf area index (LAI) measurements (n=26) acquired over alfalfa, sugar beet and garlic crops of the Barrax test site (Spain), it is demonstrated that the proposed regularization using neighbourhood information yields more accurate results compared to the pixel-based inversion. With the proposed regularization, the RMSE between ground measured and Sentinel-2 derived LAI is 0.54m 2/m 2 and hence significantly lower compared to the RMSE of the standard inversion approach (RMSE: 1.46m 2/m 2) and also of higher accuracy compared to a scaled NDVI model (RMSE: 0.90m 2/m 2). At the same time, a positive effect on the modelled leaf chlorophyll content (C ab) is noticed, albeit too few field measurements were available for deriving statistically sound results. For the other retrieved biophysical parameters such as leaf dry matter content (C m), soil brightness ($\alpha$ soil) and average leaf angle (ALA) the proposed algorithm yields more plausible and spatially consistent results. Altogether the findings confirm the positive effect of regularizing the model inversion using spatial constraints. As for any other inversion strategy, the approach requires a RTM well suited for the crop under study. For three additional crops (maize, potatoes and sunflower), the forward modelling with field measured LAI did not match the observed signatures. Consequently, for these canopies both the standard and the object-based inversion failed. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Hunt2012,
abstract = {Fuel moisture content (FMC), an important variable for predicting the occurrence and spread of wildfire, is the ratio of foliar water content and foliar dry matter content. One approach for the remote sensing of FMC has been to estimate the change in canopy water content over time by using a liquid-water spectral index. Recently, the normalized dry matter index (NDMI) was developed for the remote sensing of dry matter content using high-spectral-resolution data. The ratio of a spectral water index and a dry matter index corresponds to the ratio of foliar water and dry matter contents; therefore, we hypothesized that FMC may be remotely sensed with a spectral water index divided by NDMI. For leaf-scale simulations using the PROSPECT (leaf optical properties spectra) model, all water index/NDMI ratios were significantly related to FMC with a second-order polynomial regression. For canopy-scale simulations using the SAIL (scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model, two water index/NDMI ratios, with numerators of the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), predicted FMC with R-2 values of 0.900 and 0.864, respectively. Leaves from three species were dried or stacked to vary FMC; measured NDII/NDMI was best related to FMC. Whereas the planned NASA mission Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) will have high spectral resolution and very high signal-to-noise properties, the planned 19-day repeat frequency will not be sufficient for monitoring FMC with NDII/NDMI. Because increased fire frequency is expected with climatic change, operational assessment of FMC at large scales may require polar-orbiting environmental sensors with narrow bands to calculate NDMI.

abstract = {This study develops a simple but physically based canopy radiative transfer scheme for photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo estimates in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (Ent DGTEM). The Ent DGTEM can represent vegetation in mixed as opposed to homogeneous canopies. With active growth and competition, it must predict radiative transfer for dynamically changing vegetation structure, and requires computational speed for coupling with atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). The canopy radiative transfer scheme accounts for both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of plant canopies by combining the simple two-stream scheme with a well-described actual vertical foliage profile, an analytically derived foliage clumping factor from geometric optical theory, and, for needleleaf trees, an empirical needle-to-shoot-clumping factor. In addition, the model accounts for the effect of trunks, which is significant in bare canopies. This model provides better radiation estimates (light profiles, albedo) than the two-stream scheme currently being used in most GCMs to describe light interactions with vegetation canopies. This scheme has the same computational cost as the current typical scheme being used in GCMs, but promises to provide better canopy radiative transfer estimates for DGVMs, particularly those that model heterogeneous vegetation canopies.},

Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models.

The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87\% and 1.73\%, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RSME of 1.84\% and 1.12\%, respectively.

abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (\%N) has been reported in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact--it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of \%N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to \%N at all wavelengths in the interval 423-855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and \%N conveys no information about \%N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710-790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar \%N.},

A typical two-layer canopy of forest understory communities is addressed in the model where a geometrically thin layer of vegetation of different structure and/or optical properties is under the main layer of canopy. The model allows to calculate reflectance spectrum in every given direction for the spectral range 400â2500nm. The model calculations show that the use of effective canopy parameters in a homogeneous canopy reflectance model may cause significant biases in estimated canopy reflectance.},

abstract = {We used synthetic reflectance spectra generated by a radiative transfer model, PROSPECT-5, to develop statistical relationships between leaf optical and chemical properties, which were applied to experimental data without any readjustment. Four distinct synthetic datasets were tested: two unrealistic, uniform distributions and two normal distributions based on statistical properties drawn from a comprehensive experimental database. Two methods used in remote sensing to retrieve vegetation chemical composition, spectral indices and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, were trained both on the synthetic and experimental datasets, and validated against observations. Results are compared to a cross-validation process and model inversion applied to the same observations. They show that synthetic datasets based on normal distributions of actual leaf chemical and structural properties can be used to optimize remotely sensed spectral indices or other retrieval methods for analysis of leaf chemical constituents. This study concludes with the definition of several polynomial relationships to retrieve leaf chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area using spectral indices, derived from synthetic data and validated on a large variety of leaf types. The straightforward method described here brings the possibility to apply or adapt statistical relationships to any type of leaf.},

abstract = {Researchers from a number of disciplines have long sought the ability to estimate the functional attributes of plant canopies, such as photosynthetic capacity, using remotely sensed data. To date, however, this goal has not been fully realized. In this study, fresh-leaf reflectance spectroscopy ($\lambda$=450-2500 nm) and a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis were used to estimate key determinants of photosynthetic capacity-namely the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V(cmax)) and regeneration (J(max))-measured with standard gas exchange techniques on leaves of trembling aspen and eastern cottonwood trees. The trees were grown across an array of glasshouse temperature regimes. The PLSR models yielded accurate and precise estimates of V(cmax) and J(max) within and across species and glasshouse temperatures. These predictions were developed using unique contributions from different spectral regions. Most of the wavelengths selected were correlated with known absorption features related to leaf water content, nitrogen concentration, internal structure, and/or photosynthetic enzymes. In a field application of our PLSR models, spectral reflectance data effectively captured the short-term temperature sensitivities of V(cmax) and J(max) in aspen foliage. These findings highlight a promising strategy for developing remote sensing methods to characterize dynamic, environmentally sensitive aspects of canopy photosynthetic metabolism at broad scales.},

abstract = {The relative concentrations of different pigments within a leaf have significant physiological and spectral consequences. Photosynthesis, light use efficiency, mass and energy exchange, and stress response are dependent on relationships among an ensemble of pigments. This ensemble also determines the visible characteristics of a leaf, which can be measured remotely and used to quantify leaf biochemistry and structure. But current remote sensing approaches are limited in their ability to resolve individual pigments. This paper focuses on the incorporation of three pigments-chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoids-into the LIBERTY leaf radiative transfer model to better understand relationships between leaf biochemical, biophysical, and spectral properties. Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi needles were collected from three sites in the California Sierra Nevada. Hemispheric single-leaf visible reflectance and transmittance and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids of fresh needles were measured. These data were input to the enhanced LIBERTY model to estimate optical and biochemical properties of pine needles. The enhanced model successfully estimated reflectance (RMSE = 0.0255, BIAS = 0.00477, RMS\%E = 16.7\%), had variable success estimating transmittance (RMSE = 0.0442, BIAS = 0.0294, RMS\%E = 181\%), and generated very good estimates of carotenoid concentrations (RMSE = 2.48????g/cm2, BIAS = 0.143????g/cm2, RMS\%E = 20.4\%), good estimates of chlorophyll a concentrations (RMSE = 10.7????g/cm2, BIAS = - 0.992????g/cm2, RMS\%E = 21.1\%), and fair estimates of chlorophyll b concentrations (RMSE = 7.49????g/cm2, BIAS = - 2.12????g/cm2, RMS\%E = 43.7\%). Overall root mean squared errors of reflectance, transmittance, and pigment concentration estimates were lower for the three-pigment model than for the single-pigment model. The algorithm to estimate three in vivo specific absorption coefficients is robust, although estimated values are distorted by inconsistencies in model biophysics. The capacity to invert the model from single-leaf reflectance and transmittance was added to the model so it could be coupled with vegetation canopy models to estimate canopy biochemistry from remotely sensed data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Foliar chlorophyll content in forested ecosystems plays a fundamental role in plant photosynthesis and can indicate vegetation stress and disturbance. However, leaf chlorophyll retrieval is complicated as canopy reflectance in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths is affected by confounding effects not only from leaf pigment concentration but also leaf area index (LAI), canopy architecture, illumination and viewing geometry and understory vegetation. Unlike empirical indices, which are often developed at leaf-level and can be species, site and time specific, a process modelling approach can account for the variation of other variables affecting canopy reflectance; therefore providing a more accurate estimate of chlorophyll content over multiple vegetation species, time-frames and across broader spatial extents. This study used a linked canopy (4-Scale) and leaf (PROSPECT) modelling approach to investigate the ability of radiative transfer models to estimate foliar chemistry for different vegetation types (broadleaf and needle leaf) from optical remote sensing data. Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species, including black spruce (Picea mariana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and a variety of canopy closures and structures. These sites were sampled over multiple time-frames to collect ground data including leaf area index, leaf reflectance spectra (400-2500nm) and laboratory leaf chlorophyll content. Canopy reflectance data were acquired from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), Landsat 5 TM and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The model results show that leaf chlorophyll content derived from satellite images demonstrates a good relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll content, with validation results of R2=0.62; p<0.001 (MERIS) and R2=0.65; p<0.001 (Landsat 5 TM), and a strong linearity with negligible systematic bias. CASI data gave a regression coefficient of R2=0.41 (p<0.05) on a reduced dataset. This research provides theoretical and operational bases for the future retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content across different vegetation species, canopy structures and over broad spatial extents; crucial characteristics for inclusion in photosynthesis and carbon cycle models. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The spectral behavior of an arid, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana), range canopy with varying quantities of live, green grass, senesced, yellow grass, weathered, gray litter, and different soil backgrounds was analyzed with a ground based radiometer. The analysis included rangeland field plots and artificial mixtures of live and dead grass. Senesced grass and weathered litter were found to significantly alter the spectral response of the range canopy in the first four Thematic Mapper wavebands (0.45â0.52; 0.52â0.60; 0.63â0.69; 0.76â0.90 $\mu$m). These influences seriously hampered the utility of spectral vegetation indices in assessing green phytomass levels. Gray litter lowered the response of the green vegetation index (GVI) and perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) while minimally influencing the ratio vegetation index (RVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Yellow, senesced grass increased the greenness response of plots without green vegetation and decreased the greenness response of plots with green vegetation. Higher reflecting soils increased the \{GVI\} and \{PVI\} response and decreased the \{RVI\} and \{NDVI\} response of comparable range canopy mixtures. Small amounts of 30 cm tall, green grass (750 kg/ha) could not be detected within a 75 cm tall, senesced grass stand (5000 kg/ha). The results of this study show spectral vegetation indices to be unreliable measures of green phytomass in arid rangelands. A mixture model employing principal component analysis was used to extract a green vegetation signal, but green phytomass detection was not improved. Apparently, the green vegetation signal emerging from range canopies is diminished by the scattering influences of the vertically oriented elements of the senesced grass phytomass.},

@article{Townsend2013,
abstract = {We agree with Knyazikhin et al. (1), who reported in a recent issue of PNAS that relationships between foliar nitrogen (\%N) and near-infrared (NIR) canopy albedo appeared to be indirect and explained largely by differences in leaf and canopy structure, primarily between conifer and broadleaf species. We disagree, however, with the conclusion that \%NâNIR correlations are necessarily spurious. On the contrary, they are consistent with ample evidence that canopy architecture and leaf structural and chemical and optical properties tend to covary among plant functional types (2ââ4), and we can exploit this tendency for the purposes of prediction and mapping. We are also troubled by certain sweeping and somewhat misleading generalizations, such as the purported implications of the authorsâ findings for all imaging spectroscopy. The analyses focused primarily on 800- to 850-nm albedo, and, thus, it is unclear whether the results are applicable to narrow-waveband (e.g., 10 nm) and full-spectrum (e.g., 400â2500 nm) studies, especially because the signature of leaf-level variation in foliar nutrients, such as nitrogen, is most prominent in shortwave infrared regions (>1,100 nm) that were not addressed by the authors (2, 3). Knyazikhin et al. (1) addressed the need to disentangle contributions of canopy structural and leaf optical properties in canopy reflectance spectra (5), but they did not provide an adequate rationale for the inference that \%N and other leaf properties cannot be characterized from imaging spectroscopy. Rather, in our opinion, the paper by Knyazikhin et al. illustrated that the biology and physics of leaves and canopies cannot be evaluated in isolation and, correspondingly, that we need to better understand why certain spectroscopic methods work, given that they are not fully reconciled by existing radiative-transfer models. More extensive simulations over broader wavelength ranges are required, using improved parameterization of leaf structural, physiological, and optical properties. For instance, the authors used a single leaf spectrum derived from one PROSPECT simulation, but, as they acknowledged, leaf albedo varies substantially among species, including those in the study, and that variation is related to physiology, biochemistry, and internal leaf structure (2, 3). Use of species-specific simulations of leaf spectra could potentially lead to significant changes in the authorsâ findings across the full 400- to 2,500-nm spectrum. Thus, a reasonable inference drawn from Knyazikhin et al. (1) and previous work (5) is that canopy structure is a potentially confounding factor in analyzing vegetation reflectance spectra, not that âNIR and/or SW broadband satellite data cannot be directly linked to leaf-level processes.â Finally, Knyazikhin et al. (1) argue that links between leaf biochemistry (e.g., \%N) and âhyperspectralâ reflectance data are obscured by variation in leaf-surface albedo, which seems inconsistent with a sizeable and growing body of empirical evidence (2, 3). Statistically robust relationships between leaf or canopy biochemistry and imaging spectroscopy, within and across a diverse range of species, have repeatedly been demonstrated, albeit for reasons that we are currently unable to fully represent within radiative-transfer models. In any case, progress in remote sensing requires integration of both biologically and physically based approaches, and better linkages between the two will improve our ability to remotely detect biologically meaningful leaf optical properties.},

abstract = {The PROSPECT leaf optical properties and SAIL canopy reflectance models were coupled and inverted using a set of 96 AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) equivalent spectra gathered in afield experiment on sugar beet plots expressing a large range in leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration, and soil color. In a first attempt, the model accurately reproduced the spectral reflectance of vegetation, using six variables: chlorophyll a + b concentration (Cab), water depth (Cw), leaf mesophyll structure parameter (N), leaf area index (LAI), mean leaf inclination angle ($\theta$l), and hot-spot size parameter (s). The four structural parameters (N, LAI, $\tau$l, and s) were poorly estimated, indicating instability in the inversion process; however, the two biochemical parameters (Cab and Cw) were evaluated reasonably well, except over very bright soils. In a second attempt, three of the four structure variables were assigned a fixed value corresponding to the average observed in the experiment. Inversions performed to retrieve the remaining structure variable, leaf area index, and the two biochemical variables showed large improvements in the accuracy of LAI, but slightly poorer performance for Cab and Cw. Here again, poor results were obtained with very bright soils. The compensations observed between the LAI and Cab or Cw  led us to evaluate the performance of two more-synthetic variables, canopy chlorophyll content or canopy water content, for these the inversions produced reasonable estimates. The application of this approach to Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data provided similar results, both for the spectrum reconstruction capability and for the retrieval of canopy biophysical characteristics.},

abstract = {An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate canopy reflectance data into an ecosystem model. We demonstrate the use of an augmented state vector approach to enable a canopy reflectance model to be used as a non-linear observation operator. A key feature of data assimilation (DA) schemes, such as the EnKF, is that they incorporate information on uncertainty in both the model and the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state of a system. In addition, estimates of uncertainty in the model outputs (given the observed data) are calculated, which is crucial in assessing the utility of model predictions. Results are compared against eddy-covariance observations of CO2 fluxes collected over three years at a pine forest site. The assimilation of 500??m spatial resolution MODIS reflectance data significantly improves estimates of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) from the model, with clear reduction in the resulting uncertainty of estimated fluxes. However, foliar biomass tends to be over-estimated compared with measurements. Issues regarding this over-estimate, as well as the various assumptions underlying the assimilation of reflectance data are discussed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Retrieving leaf chlorophyll content at a range of spatio-temporal scales is central to monitoring vegetation productivity, identifying physiological stress and managing biological resources. However, estimating leaf chlorophyll over broad spatial extents using ground-based traditional methods is time and resource heavy. Satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to estimate leaf chlorophyll content, however they are often developed and tested on broadleaf species. Relatively little research has assessed VIs for different leaf structures, particularly needle leaves which represent a large component of boreal forest and significant global ecosystems. This study tested the performance of 47 published VIs for estimating foliar chlorophyll content from different leaf and canopy structures (broadleaf and needle). Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species (Picea mariana and Acer saccharum) and a variety of canopy structures. Leaf reflectance data was collected using an ASD Fieldspec Pro spectroradiometer (400-2500nm) for over 300 leaf samples. Canopy reflectance data was acquired from the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS). At the canopy level, with both leaf types combined, the DD-index showed the strongest relationship with leaf chlorophyll (R2=0.78; RMSE=3.56??g/cm2), despite differences in leaf structure. For needleleaf trees alone the relationship with the top VI was weaker (D[red], R2=0.71; RMSE=2.32??g/cm2). A sensitivity study using simulated VIs from physically-modelled leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy (4-Scale) reflectance was performed in order to further investigate these results and assess the impacts of different background types and leaf area index on the VIs' performance. At the leaf level, the MNDVI8 index showed a strong linearity to changing chlorophyll and negligible difference to leaf structure/type. At canopy level, the best performing VIs were relatively consistent where LAI???4, but responded strongly to differences in background at low canopy coverage (LAI=2). This research provides comprehensive assessments for the use of spectral indices in retrieval of spatially-continuous leaf chlorophyll content at the leaf (MTCI: R2=0.72; p<0.001) and canopy (DD: R2=0.78; p<0.001) level for resource management over different spatial and temporal scales. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An explicit analytical model for calculating vegetation canopy reflectance, the multiple-layer canopy radiative transfer model (MRTM), has been developed in this paper. The model is based on radiative transfer theory by separating the roles of incident direct and diffuse radiation and radiation singly and multiply scattered by foliage. Specifically, the vertical heterogeneity of biophysical and biochemical parameters within the canopy was carefully treated in the model. This model was validated with field measurements from a deciduous forest canopy. The results proved that the model could reproduce the measured reflectance quite well. In addition, the performance of MRTM was found to be superior in comparison to other canopy models such as PROSAIL, ACRM and FRT. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity on the canopy reflectance was clearly identified by different scenarios, which indicates that the influence of vertical variation in leaf area density and leaf chlorophyll, water, and dry matter contents cannot be neglected, especially when the total LAI is large. If such influences are ignored, significant biases in the estimated canopy reflectance can be expected. Since this multiple-layer model is a hybrid one that offers efficient calculation, it could serve as a primary model to develop more accurate reflectance models for inhomogeneous forests at plot and regional scales in future studies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Inter-particle shadowing effects in the regolith are modelled using ray-tracing simulations, and then a phase function is fit to the data using Bayesian techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Additionally, the data are fit with phase functions computed from radiative-transfer coherent-backscatter (RT-CB) simulations. The results indicate that the lunar photometry, including both the opposition effect and azimuthal effects, can be explained well with a combination of inter-particle shadowing and coherent backscattering. Our results produce loose constraints on the mare physical properties. The RT-CB results indicate that the scattering volume element is optically thick. In both the Bayesian analysis and the RT-CB fit, models with lower packing density and/or higher surface roughness always produce better fits to the data than densely packed, smoother ones.},

However, the translation of remote sensing signals into meaningful descriptors of vegetation function and traits is still associated with large uncertainties due to complex interactions between leaf, canopy, and atmospheric mediums, and significant challenges in the treatment of confounding factors in spectrum-trait relations. This editorial provides (1) a background on major advances in the remote sensing of vegetation, (2) a detailed timeline and description of relevant historical and planned satellite missions, and (3) an outline of remaining challenges, upcoming opportunities and key research objectives to be tackled. The introduction sets the stage for thirteen Special Issue papers here that focus on novel approaches for exploiting current and future advancements in remote sensor technologies.

abstract = {The dynamics of foliar chlorophyll concentrations have considerable significance for plant-environment interactions, ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Hyperspectral remote sensing has a valuable role in the monitoring of such dynamics. This study focussed upon improving the accuracy of chlorophyll quantification by applying wavelet analysis to reflectance spectra. Leaf-scale radiative transfer models were used to generate very large spectral data sets with which to develop and rigorously test refinements to the approach and compare it with existing spectral indices. The results demonstrated that by decomposing leaf spectra, the resultant wavelet coefficients can be used to generate accurate predictions of chlorophyll concentration, despite wide variations in the range of other biochemical and biophysical factors that influence leaf reflectance. Wavelet analysis outperformed predictive models based on untransformed spectra and a range of spectral indices. The paper discusses the possibilities for further refining the wavelet approach and for extending the technique to the sensing of a variety of vegetation properties at a range of spatial scales. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

When run in the forward mode, LEAFMOD generates an estimate of leaf reflectance and transmittance given the leaf thickness and optical characteristics of the leaf material (i.e., the absorption and scattering coefficients). In the inverse mode, LEAFMOD computes the total within-leaf absorption and scattering coefficient profiles from measured reflectance, transmittance, and leaf thickness. Inversions with simulated data demonstrate that the model appropriately decouples scattering and absorption within the leaf, producing fresh leaf absorption profiles with peaks at locations corresponding to the major absorption features for water and chlorophyll. Experiments with empirical input data demonstrate that the amplitude of the fresh leaf absorption coefficient profile in the visible wavebands is correlated with pigment concentrations as determined by wet chemical analyses, and that absorption features in the near-infrared wavebands related to various other biochemical constituents can be identified in a dry-leaf absorption profile.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll a+b (Ca+b) and carotenoids (Cx+c) are leaf pigments associated with photosynthesis, participation in light harvesting and energy transfer, quenching and photoprotection. This manuscript makes progress on developing methods for leaf carotenoid content estimation, using high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Imagery was acquired over 3 years using two different UAV platforms, a 6-band multispectral camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager flown with 260 bands at 1.85nm/pixel and 12-bit radiometric resolution, yielding 40cm pixel size and a FWHM of 6.4nm with a 25-$\mu$m slit in the 400-885nm spectral region. Field data collections were conducted in August 2009-2011 in the western area of Ribera del Duero Appellation d'Origine, northern Spain. A total of twelve full production vineyards and two study plots per field were selected to ensure appropriate variability in leaf biochemistry and vine physiological conditions. Leaves were collected for destructive sampling and biochemical determination of chlorophyll a+b and carotenoids conducted in the laboratory. In addition to leaf sampling and biochemical determination, canopy structural parameters, such as grid size, number of vines within each plot, trunk height, plant height and width, and row orientation, were measured on each 10mÃ10m plot. The R515/R570 index recently proposed for carotenoid estimation in conifer forest canopies was explored for vineyards in this study. The PROSPECT-5 leaf radiative transfer model, which simulates the carotenoid and chlorophyll content effects on leaf reflectance and transmittance, was linked to the SAILH and FLIGHT canopy-level radiative transfer models, as well as to simpler approximations based on infinite reflectance Râ formulations. The objective was to simulate the pure vine reflectance without soil and shadow effects due to the high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired from the UAV, which enabled targeting pure vines. The simulation results obtained with synthetic spectra demonstrated the effects due to Ca+b content on leaf Cx+c estimation when the R515/R570 index was used. Therefore, scaling up methods were proposed for leaf carotenoid content estimation based on the combined R515/R570 (sensitive to Cx+c) and TCARI/OSAVI (sensitive to Ca+b) narrow-band indices. Results demonstrated the feasibility of mapping leaf carotenoid concentration at the pure-vine level from high resolution hyperspectral imagery, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) below 1.3$\mu$g/cm2 and a relative RMSE (R-RMSE) of 14.4\% (FLIGHT) and 12.9\% (SAILH) for the 2 years of hyperspectral imagery. The simpler formulation based on the infinite reflectance model by Yamada and Fujimura yielded lower errors (RMSE=0.87$\mu$g/cm2; R-RMSE<9.7\%), although the slope deviated more from the 1:1 line. Maps showing the spatial variability of leaf carotenoid content were estimated using this methodology, which targeted pure vines without shadow and background effects. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Leaf mass per area (LMA), the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf area, is a trait of central importance to the understanding of plant light capture and carbon gain. It can be estimated from leaf reflectance spectroscopy in the infrared region, by making use of information about the absorption features of dry matter. This study reports on the application of continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) to the estimation of LMA across a wide range of plant species. We compiled a large database of leaf reflectance spectra acquired within the framework of three independent measurement campaigns (ANGERS, LOPEX and PANAMA) and generated a simulated database using the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model. CWA was applied to the measured and simulated databases to extract wavelet features that correlate with LMA. These features were assessed in terms of predictive capability and robustness while transferring predictive models from the simulated database to the measured database. The assessment was also conducted with two existing spectral indices, namely the Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI) and the Normalized Difference index for LMA (NDLMA).Five common wavelet features were determined from the two databases, which showed significant correlations with LMA (R2: 0.51-0.82, p<0.0001). The best robustness (R2=0.74, RMSE=18.97g/m2 and Bias=0.12g/m2) was obtained using a combination of two low-scale features (1639nm, scale 4) and (2133nm, scale 5), the first being predominantly important. The transferability of the wavelet-based predictive model to the whole measured database was either better than or comparable to those based on spectral indices. Additionally, only the wavelet-based model showed consistent predictive capabilities among the three measured data sets. In comparison, the models based on spectral indices were sensitive to site-specific data sets. Integrating the NDLMA spectral index and the two robust wavelet features improved the LMA prediction. One of the bands used by this spectral index, 1368nm, was located in a strong atmospheric water absorption region and replacing it with the next available band (1340nm) led to lower predictive accuracies. However, the two wavelet features were not affected by data quality in the atmospheric absorption regions and therefore showed potential for canopy-level investigations. The wavelet approach provides a different perspective into spectral responses to LMA variation than the traditional spectral indices and holds greater promise for implementation with airborne or spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data for mapping canopy foliar dry biomass.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a simulation approach for testing the sensitivity of linear and non-parametric trend analysis methods applied to remotely sensed vegetation index data for the detection of land degradation. The intensity, rate and timing of reductions in seasonally-summed NDVI are systematically varied on sample data to simulate land degradation, after which the trend analysis was applied and its sensitivity evaluated. The study was based on a widely-used, 1km2 AVHRR data set for a test area in southern Africa. The trends were the most negative and significant when the degradation was introduced rapidly (over a period of 2â5years) and in the middle of a 16-year time series. The seasonally-summed NDVI needs to be reduced by 30â40\% before a significant negative linear slope or Kendall's correlation coefficient was apparent, given an underlying positive trend caused by rainfall. The seasonally-summed data were reordered to remove this underlying positive trend, before simulating degradation again. With no underlying positive trend present, degradation of 20\% resulted in significant negative trends. Since areas widely agreed to be degraded show only 10â20\% reductions compared to non-degraded areas, this raises doubts over the ability of trend analyses to detect degradation in a timely way in the presence of underling environmental trends. Residual Trends Analysis (RESTREND) was applied in an attempt to correct for variability and trends in rainfall. However, a simulated degradation intensity â¥20\% caused the otherwise strong relationship between NDVI and rainfall to break down, making the RESTREND an unreliable indicator of land degradation. The results of such analyses will vary between different environments and need to be tested for sample areas across regions. Although the paper does not claim to solve the challenge of detecting land degradation amidst rainfall variability, it introduces a method of assessing the sensitivity of land degradation monitoring using remote sensing data.},

abstract = {An ecological consequence of plant-herbivore interactions is the phytochemical induction of defenses in response to insect damage. Here, we used reflectance spectroscopy to characterize the foliar induction profile of cardenolides in Asclepias syriaca in response to damage, tracked in vivo changes and examined the influence of multiple plant traits on cardenolide concentrations. Foliar cardenolide concentrations were measured at specific time points following damage to capture their induction profile. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling was employed to calibrate cardenolide concentrations to reflectance spectroscopy. In addition, subsets of plants were either repeatedly sampled to track in vivo changes or modified to reduce latex flow to damaged areas. Cardenolide concentrations and the induction profile of A. syriaca were well predicted using models derived from reflectance spectroscopy, and this held true for repeatedly sampled plants. Correlations between cardenolides and other foliar-related variables were weak or not significant. Plant modification for latex reduction inhibited an induced cardenolide response. Our findings show that reflectance spectroscopy can characterize rapid phytochemical changes in vivo. We used reflectance spectroscopy to identify the mechanisms behind the production of plant secondary metabolites, simultaneously characterizing multiple foliar constituents. In this case, cardenolide induction appears to be largely driven by enhanced latex delivery to leaves following damage.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in L-band (1.4GHz) microwave radiative transfer modeling (RTM) affect the simulation of brightness temperatures (Tb) over land and the inversion of satellite-observed Tb into soil moisture retrievals. In particular, accurate estimates of the microwave soil roughness, vegetation optical depth and scattering albedo for large-scale applications are difficult to obtain from field studies and often lack an estimate of uncertainty. Here, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method is used to determine satellite-scale estimates of RTM parameters and their posterior uncertainty by minimizing the misfit between long-term averages and standard deviations of simulated and observed Tb at multiple incidence angles, at horizontal and vertical polarizations, and for morning and evening overpasses. Tb simulations are generated with the land model component of the Goddard Earth Observing System (version 5) and confronted with Tb observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity satellite mission. The maximum a posteriori density (MAP) parameter values reduce the root-mean-square differences between observed and simulated long-term Tb averages and standard deviations to 3.4K and 2.3K, respectively. The relative uncertainty of the posterior RTM parameter estimates is typically less than 25\% of the MAP parameter value, whereas it exceeds 100\% for literature-based prior parameter estimates. It is also shown that the parameter values estimated through Particle Swarm Optimization are in close agreement with those obtained from MCMC simulation. The MCMC results for the RTM parameter values and the uncertainties presented herein are directly relevant to the need for accurate Tb modeling in global land data assimilation systems.},

abstract = {Air pollution affects large areas of forest, and field assessment of these effects is a costly, site-specific process. This paper establishes a biochemical basis for identifying ozone-damaged pine trees to facilitate efficient remote sensing assessment of air pollution damage. Several thousand live needles were collected from ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi) trees at three sites in Plumas National Forest and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. These needles were assembled into 504 samples (based on the abaxial surface) and grouped according to five dominant needle conditions (green, winter fleck, sucking insect damage, scale insect damage, and ozone damage) and a random mixture of needles. Pigment concentrations per unit needle area of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoids were measured. The following pigment concentration ratios were calculated for all samples: chlorophyll a/total carotenoids, chlorophyll b/total carotenoids, total chlorophyll/carotenoids, chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b. The group of ozone-damaged needles had significantly lower mean pigment concentrations (family-wise p < 0.01) and significantly lower mean chlorophyll a/total carotenoid and total chlorophyll/total carotenoid ratios (family-wise p < 0.01) than all other groups of needles. Ozone-damaged needles had a significantly lower mean chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio than all other groups except one (family-wise p < 0.01). Linear discriminant analysis with three factors (chlorophyll a concentration, the chlorophyll a/carotenoid ratio, and the chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio) and subsequent maximum likelihood classification of damaged and non-damaged needles gave an overall cross-validated accuracy of 96\%. These ozone-damaged needles are biochemically unique in relation to other needle conditions in this study, and further research is needed to generalize these results.},

abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

abstract = {A globally consistent methodology using satellite imagery was implemented to quantify gross forest cover loss (GFCL) from 2000 to 2005 and to compare GFCL among biomes, continents, and countries. GFCL is defined as the area of forest cover removed because of any disturbance, including both natural and human-induced causes. GFCL was estimated to be 1,011,000 km(2) from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1\% (0.6\% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest area of 32,688,000 km(2). The boreal biome experienced the largest area of GFCL, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. GFCL expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. Among continents, North America had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 GFCL. At national scales, Brazil experienced the largest area of GFCL over the study period, 165,000 km(2), followed by Canada at 160,000 km(2). Of the countries with >1,000,000 km(2) of forest cover, the United States exhibited the greatest proportional GFCL and the Democratic Republic of Congo the least. Our results illustrate a pervasive global GFCL dynamic. However, GFCL represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving GFCL and rates of recovery from GFCL differ regionally. For example, the majority of estimated GFCL for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. To fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating GFCL to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from GFCL.},

abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content in coniferous forest canopies, a measure of stand condition, is the target of studies and models linking leaf reflectance and transmittance and canopy hyperspectral reflectance imagery. The viability of estimation of needle chlorophyll content from airborne hyperspectral optical data through inversion of linked leaf level and canopy level radiative transfer models is discussed in this paper. This study is focused on five sites of Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) in the Algoma Region (Canada), where field, laboratory and airborne data were collected in 1998 and 1999 campaigns. Airborne hyperspectral CASI data of 72 bands in the visible and near-infrared region and 2 m spatial resolution were collected from 20 x 20 m study sites of Jack Pine in 2 consecutive years. It was found that needle chlorophyll content could be estimated at the leaf level (r 2=0.4) by inversion of the PROSPECT leaf model from needle reflectance and transmittance spectra collected with a special needle carrier apparatus coupled to the Li-Cor 1800 integrating sphere. The Jack Pine forest stands used for this study with LAI>2, and the high spatial resolution hyperspectral reflectance collected, allowed the use of the SPRINT canopy reflectance model coupled to PROSPECT for needle chlorophyll content estimation by model inversion. The optical index R750/R710 was used as the merit function in the numerical inversion to minimize the effect of shadows and LAI variation in the mean canopy reflectance from the 20 x 20 m plots. Estimates of needle pigment content from airborne hyperspectral reflectance using this linked leaf-canopy model inversion methodology showed an r 2=0.4 and RMSE=8.1 ??g/cm 2 when targeting sunlit crown pixels in Jack Pine sites with pigment content ranging between 26.8 and 56.8 ??g/cm 2 (1570-3320 ??g/g). ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is the most destructive insect infesting mature pine forests in North America and has devastated millions of hectares of forest in western Canada. Past studies have demonstrated the use of multispectral imagery for remote identification and mapping of visible or red attack damage in forests. This study aims to detect pre-visual or green attack damage in lodgepole pine needles by means of hyperspectral measurements, particularly via continuous wavelet analysis. Field measurements of lodgepole pine stands were conducted at two sites located northwest of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In June and August of 2007, reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) were collected for 16 pairs of trees. Each of the 16 tree pairs included one control tree (healthy), and one stressed tree (girdled to simulate the effects of beetle infestation). In addition, during the period of June through October 2008, spectra were collected from 15 pairs of control- and beetle-infested trees. Spectra derived from these 31 tree pairs were subjected to a continuous wavelet transform, generating a scalogram that compiles the wavelet power as a function of wavelength location and scale of decomposition. Linear relationships were then explored between the wavelet scalograms and chemical properties or class labels (control and non-control) of the sample populations in order to isolate the most useful distinguishing spectral features that related to infested or girdled trees vs. control trees. A deficit in water content is observed in infested trees while an additional deficit in chlorophyll content is seen for girdled trees. The measurable water deficit of infested and girdled tree samples was detectable from the wavelet analysis of the reflectance spectra providing a novel method for the detection of green attack. The spectral features distinguishing control and infested trees are predominantly located between 950 and 1390 nm from scales 1 to 8. Of those, five features between 1318 to 1322 nm at scale 7 are consistently found in the July and August 2008 datasets. These features are located at longer wavelengths than those investigated in previous studies (below 1100 nm) and provide new insights into the potential remote detection of green attack. Spectral features that distinguish control and girdled trees were mostly observed between 1550 and 2370 nm from scales 1 to 5. The differing response of girdled and infested trees appears to indicate that the girdling process does not provide a perfect simulation of the effects caused by beetle infestation. It remains to be determined if the location of the 1318-1322 nm features, near the edge of a strong atmospheric water absorption band, will be sufficiently separable for use in airborne detection of green attack. A plot comparing needle water content and wavelet power at 1320 nm reveals considerable overlap between data derived from both infested and control samples, though the groups are statistically separable. This obstacle may preclude a high accuracy separation of healthy and infected single individuals, but establishing threshold identification levels may provide an economical, efficient and expeditious method for discriminating between healthy and infested tree populations.

abstract = {Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy produced a 1 km resolution global land cover characteristics database for use in a wide range of continental-to global-scale environmental studies. This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity.

This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include IGBP DISCover, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote Sensing Land Cover.

In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical computation.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a basic quantity indicating crop growth situation and plays a significant role in agricultural, ecological and meteorological models at local, regional and global scale. It is a common approach to invert LAI based on canopy reflectance models using optimization method. Radiative transfer model for continuous vegetation canopy such as SAIL models is widely used for crop LAI inversion. However, crops are mostly planted as row structure in China and they don't fit the assumptions of continuous vegetation especially at the earlier growth stages. What kind of models should be used to invert LAI for typical row-planted crops at different growing stages? Taking corn as an example, the factors which influence the row planted crop LAI estimation are investigated in this paper. Using the computer simulated BRDF data sets, different models for LAI inversion at different growth stages are evaluated based on parameter sensitivity analysis. Bayes theory is used to introduce a priori knowledge in the inversion process. In 2005, a field campaign is carried out to validate LAI inversion accuracy during corn's growing stages in Huailai, Hebei Province, China. Inverted LAI from both the measured Canopy Reflectance (CR) data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are very promising. The results show that at least two kinds of models should be adopted for corn canopy at different growth stages, i.e., row structure model for early growth stage (before elongation) and homogeneous canopy model for later growth stage (after elongation).},

abstract = {The leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by the vegetation are key biophysical measures of canopy foliage area and light harvesting potential. Accurately quantifying these properties is important for characterizing the dynamics of mass and energy exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere. The overall objective of this research was to validate the spatial and temporal performance of the MODIS LAI/FPAR products for a boreal forest landscape in northern Manitoba, Canada. We examined both the MODIS collection 4 (C4) and updated collection 5 (C5) versions over a multiyear period (2004 to 2006) and spatially across seven different-aged forests originating from wildfire and ranging in age from 1- to 154-years-old. We made optical measurements of LAI and FPAR, which were empirically scaled to high-resolution imagery (ASTER; 15-30. m pixel size) to derive detailed reference LAI and FPAR maps. These maps were then aggregated to MODIS resolution (i.e. 1. km) for comparison. We characterized the temporal accuracy of the MODIS products using repeat measurements of LAI and FPAR, and through comparisons with continuously operating measurements of canopy light interception.MODIS captured the general phenological trajectory of these aggrading forests, however the MODIS LAI and FPAR products overestimated and underestimated the LAI and FPAR for the youngest and oldest sites, respectively. In addition, MODIS displayed larger seasonal variation in LAI and FPAR compared to field measurements for the needle-leaf evergreen dominated sites. The peak growing season difference between MODIS and spatially aggregated ASTER reference values of LAI and FPAR decreased significantly by 69\% and 55\%, respectively, for the updated C5 versus the previous C4 LAI/FPAR products. The overall uncertainty (i.e. RMSE) in the MODIS LAI retrievals decreased from 1.6 (C4) to 0.63m2m-2 (C5) and from 0.20 (C4) to 0.07 (C5) for FPAR. The incorporation of understory vegetation into the validation of the MODIS products yielded significantly higher agreement between observed and MODIS values, likely due to the relatively open canopy architecture and abundant understory found within boreal forests. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the last few years, encouraging results using radiative transfer model inversion techniques were obtained for land biophysical variables retrieval. However, the inversion of radiative transfer models is a severely ill-posed problem that may lead to significant uncertainties in the biophysical variables estimates. Improvement of performances of the inversion process requires more information to be exploited including better radiative transfer models, exploitation of proper prior information on the distribution of canopy and atmosphere variables, knowledge of uncertainties in satellite measurements, as well as possible spatial and temporal constraints. In this study we focus on the use of coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transfer models (SMAC + SAIL + PROSPECT) to estimate some key biophysical variables from top of atmosphere canopy reflectance data. The inversion is achieved over an ensemble of pixels belonging to a spatial window where aerosol properties are supposed to be constant, and over a temporal window of few days where vegetation state is assumed not to vary. The ensemble inversion scheme accounting for the spatial and temporal constraints is described. Top of atmosphere reflectance observations are simulated for 13 bands within the visible and near infrared domains. The coupled model is inverted with a variational method implementation dedicated to solve very large inverse problems. It is based on the use of the adjoint model and a Quasi-Newton optimisation technique with BFGS update. The multitemporal-patch inversion approach exploiting the spatial and temporal constraints is compared to the classical instantaneous-local inversion applied on single pixel and date. The 'ensemble' approach shows significant performance improvements when retrieving aerosol optical thickness $\tau$550 and some canopy characteristics (LAI, LAI Ã Cab and ALA). Conclusions are drawn on the interest of such approaches, and perspectives are given, with due attention to their applicability within operational algorithms. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) are important vegetation variables which can be monitored using remote sensing (RS). Physically-based approaches have higher transferability and are therefore better suited than empirically-based approaches for estimating LAI and Cab at global scales. These approaches, however, require the inversion of radiative transfer (RT) models, which is an ill-posed and underdetermined problem. Four regularization methods have been proposed, allowing finding stable solutions: 1) model coupling, 2) using a priori information (e.g. Bayesian approaches), 3) spatial constraints (e.g. using objects), and 4) temporal constraints. For mono-temporal data, only the first three methods can be applied. In an earlier study, we presented a Bayesian object-based algorithm for inverting the SLC-MODTRAN4 coupled canopy-atmosphere RT model, and compared it with a Bayesian LUT inversion. The results showed that the object-based approach provided more accurate LAI estimates. This study, however, heavily relied on expert knowledge about the objects and vegetation classes. Therefore, in this new contribution, we investigated the applicability of the Bayesian object-based inversion of the SLC-MODTRAN4 model to a situation where no such knowledge was available. The case study used a 16Ã22km2 simulated top-of-atmosphere image of the upcoming Sentinel-2 sensor, covering the area near the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Seven APEX radiance images were nadir-normalized using the parametric LiâRoss model, spectrally and spatially resampled to Sentinel-2 specifications, geometrically corrected, and mosaicked. The atmospheric effects between APEX flight height and top-of-atmosphere level were added based on two MODTRAN4 simulations. The vegetation objects were identified and delineated using a segmentation algorithm, and classified in four levels of brightness in the visible domain. The LAI and Cab maps obtained from the Bayesian object-based inversion of the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 model presented realistic spatial patterns. The impact of the parametric LiâRoss nadir-normalization was evaluated by comparing 1) the angular signatures of the SLC-MODTRAN4 and LiâRoss models, and 2) the LAI and Cab maps obtained from a LiâRoss nadir-normalized image (using nadir viewing geometry) and from the original image (using the original viewing geometry). The differences in angular signatures were small but systematic, and the differences between the LAI and Cab maps increased from the center towards the edges of the across-track direction. The results of this study contribute to preparing the RS community for the arrival of Sentinel-2 data in the near future, and generalize the applicability of the Bayesian object-based approach for estimating vegetation variables to cases where no field data are available.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed data is the main source of vegetation leaf area index (LAI) information on the regional to global scale. Many validation results have revealed that the accuracy of the retrieved LAI is often affected by the cloud cover of imagery, instrument problems, and inversion algorithms. Ground meteorological station data, characterized by relatively high accuracy and time continuity compared with remote sensing data, can provide complementary information to remote sensing observations. In this paper, we combine the potential advantages of both types of data in order to improve LAI retrievals in the Heihe River Basin, an arid and semi-arid area in northwest China where Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI values are significantly underestimated. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used to integrate these two data types for time series LAI estimation. Results show that the square of correlation coefficient between LAI values estimated by our DBN method (referred to as DBN LAI) and field measured LAI values is 0.76, with a root mean square error of 0.78. The DBN LAI are closer to field measurements than the MODIS LAI standard product values. Moreover, by introducing ground meteorological station data using a dynamic process model, DBN LAI show better temporal consistency than the MODIS LAI. It is concluded that the quality of LAI retrievals can be improved by combining remote sensing data and ground meteorological station data using a filtering inference algorithm in a DBN framework. More importantly, the study provides a basis and method for utilizing ground meteorological station network data to estimate land surface parameters on a regional scale.},

abstract = {Early detection of crop injury from herbicide glyphosate is of significant importance in crop management. In this paper, we attempt to detect glyphosate-induced crop injury by PROSPECT (leaf optical PROperty SPECTra model) inversion through leaf hyperspectral reflectance measurements for non-Glyphosate- Resistant (non-GR) soybean and non-GR cotton leaves. The PROSPECT model was inverted to retrieve chlorophyll content (Ca+b), equivalent water thickness (Cw), and leaf mass per area (Cm) from leaf hyperspectral reflectance spectra. The leaf stress conditions were then evaluated by examining the temporal variations of these biochemical constituents after glyphosate treatment. The approach was validated with greenhouse-measured datasets. Results indicated that the leaf injury caused by glyphosate treatments could be detected shortly after the spraying for both soybean and cotton by PROSPECT inversion, with Caa+b of the leaves treated with high dose solution decreasing more rapidly compared with leaves left untreated, whereas the Cw and Cm showed no obvious difference between treated and untreated leaves. For both non-GR soybean and non-GR cotton, the retrieved Ca+b values of the glyphosate treated plants from leaf hyperspectral data could be distinguished from that of the untreated plants within 48 h after the treatment, which could be employed as a useful indicator for glyphosate injury detection. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying the PROSPECT inversion technique for the early detection of leaf injury from glyphosate and its potential for agricultural plant status monitoring.

abstract = {The PROSPECT leaf optical model has, to date, combined the effects of photosynthetic pigments, but a finer discrimination among the key pigments is important for physiological and ecological applications of remote sensing. Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE = 9 $\mu$g/cm2) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE = 3 $\mu$g/cm2). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400-2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need to monitor the dynamics of green LAI of field crops through the growing season. A simple approach is to use a regression model to estimate crop LAI from a vegetation index derived from optical remote sensing data. However, variations of interference factors in the signal path could induce variations in spectral reflectance, leading to uncertainty in LAI estimation. A semi-empirical equation was implemented to estimate green LAI of field crops from Landsat-5/7 data using a few vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), the two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and the modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2). Data were collected during several growing seasons, from 1999 to 2006, over corn, soybean, and spring wheat fields in an experimental farm in Ottawa (ON, Canada). LAI estimated for corn, soybean and wheat from Landsat data using the vegetation indices was compared to ground LAI. Except for NDVI, comparable results were obtained from the other three vegetation indices, with a coefficient of determination above 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) not more than 0.60. The performance of NDVI was less satisfactory (RMSE. >. 0.66). The uncertainties in LAI estimation induced by variations in soil reflectance, leaf optical properties, canopy structure, and atmospheric conditions were assessed through a global sensitivity analyses using the PROSPECT leaf model coupled to the SAIL canopy model along with the 6S atmospheric transmission model. The sensitivity analyses show that different indices are affected differently by the various interference factors. Comparatively, NDVI is the most influenced by leaf chlorophyll but the least affected by leaf inclination, OSAVI and the narrow band MTVI2 are more efficient in reducing soil effects, and EVI2 has a better performance in reducing aerosol perturbation. At high LAI, the uncertainty of NDVI is the smallest, but the uncertainty propagated to LAI estimation is the largest due to saturation. In this case, vegetation indices that are less prone to saturation should be considered, such as EVI2 and MTVI2. When MTVI2 is used on multispectral data, its ability to reduce soil and leaf chlorophyll perturbation is similar to EVI2 but weaker than when it is used on hyperspectral data. These results show that vegetation indices can be used in a simple regression model to generate baseline green LAI product for seasonal crop growth monitoring, however it is important to be aware of the sources of uncertainty and their relative amplitudes when using the product.

abstract = {The global net uptake of carbon (C) by the terrestrial biosphere av- eraged 1.4 Gt C yâ1 during the 1990s. Although temperate forests have been identified as significant contributors to this uptake, the underlying biological mechanisms through which this uptake has occurred have re- mained a matter of debate, largely because many of the spatiotemporal scales on which these mechanisms operate are not yet accessible to di- rect, continuous measurement. To fill this gap in our understanding, in this thesis I develop a new terrestrial biosphere model, version 2 of the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2). I used ED2 to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, water fluxes, and tree growth and mortality rates at Harvard Forest. These simulation results were compared to eddy covariance data and biometry data, and model parameters were adjusted until the model was in accord with the data. The optimized model gave greatly improved predictions of net ecosystem productivity and of growth and mortality rates at bothHarvard Forest (hardwood-dominated) and at Howland Forest (conifer- dominated). I also used the model to predict regional vegetation dynamics and C fluxes. The simulated region encompassed the northeastern U.S. and southern Quebec (from 41â¦N to 52â¦N and from 80â¦W to 65â¦W). The modeled regional growth and mortality rates compared favorably to the observed rates. I then performed a factor analysis to determine mechanisms driving interannual variability in the regional C fluxes. I found that meteorolog- ical variability had a strong, non-linear effect, suppressing both photo- synthesis and respiration. The interannual variability in the total land- atmosphere C flux was primarily controlled by interannual variability in heterotrophic respiration. In particular, the years in which the land most strongly acted as a C sink were the years in which dry summers most strongly suppressed heterotrophic respiration. Finally, I investigated the atmospheric signatures of CO2 fluxes using ED2 coupled to a new, mass-conserving version of the Regional Atmo- spheric Modeling System developed here. The coupled model success- fully predicted altitudinal gradients of CO2 as observed by aircraft under a variety of meteorological conditions, but it underpredicted the gradient on several sunny, warm days.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that the mass-based concentration of nitrogen in foliage (\%N) is positively correlated with canopy near-infrared reflectance (NIRr) and midsummer shortwave albedo across North American forests. Understanding the mechanisms behind this relationship would aid in interpretation of remote sensing imagery and improve our ability to predict changes in reflectance under future environmental conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which foliar nitrogen at leaf and canopy scales covary with leaf- and canopy-scale structural traits that are known to influence NIR scattering and reflectance. To accomplish this, we compared leaf and canopy traits with reflectance spectra at 17 mixed temperate forest stands.We found significant positive associations among \%N and NIRr at both the leaf and canopy scale. At the canopy scale, both \%N and NIRr were correlated with a number of structural traits as well as with the proportional abundance of deciduous and evergreen foliage. Identifying specific causal factors for observed reflectance patterns was complicated by interrelations among multiple traits across scales.Amongsimple metrics of canopy structure,wesawnorelationship between NIRrandleaf area index, butweobserved a strong, inverse relationship with the number of leaves per unit canopy volume.},
